# API Gateway Assignment

This is a university assignment made to demonstrate the use of the API Gateway design pattern. It involves three microservices: Auth, Todos and News, and a Gateway which routes the traffic to these services based on the request.

Python FastAPI is used for the gateway, auth and todos API. Java Springboot for the news API.
